    "To test the accuracy of the UShER method for assigning lineages, I split the O1 Vibrio cholerae dataset 90-10 into a train and test set. Because of size differences between lineages, this split was performed on each lineage independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the test set contains 10% of the UNK sequences, 10% of T1, 10% of T2, etc. For the training set, I reconstructed a phylogeny, converted to an UShER tree, and inferred the MRCA of each lineage using `matUtils annotate`. The annotated pb tree will be used as the guide tree into which I will place each sequence in the test set. Accuracy will be determined by the percentage of sequences that have a correct lineage assignment."
